# Virtual Pilatus3

This repository contains a python program that simulates the [Dectris Pilatus3 camserver control program's socket interface](https://media.dectris.com/user-manual-pilatus3-2020_GOKBotG.pdf). It has been tested against the [EPICS areaDetector ADPilatus driver](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPilatus), and is known to behave similarly to a real detector.
